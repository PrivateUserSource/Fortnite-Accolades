# Fortnite-Accolades
all accolades for fortnite (currently only has s12)

### Credits
- FModel
- PrivateUser (for getting them)

### Explanation
Uh, so getting accolades isnt hard at all, go in FModel, search for Accolades and you get all of them, their folder path is "FortniteGame/Content/Athena/Items/Accolades"
Mainly made this repo cuz people are way to stupid to get them themselves.

I'll add more to this in the future (if i feel like it lmao)
